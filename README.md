## Features

- **Data Processing**:
  - Extract and transform retail data using Hadoop (HDFS, Hive) and PySpark.
  - Data ingestion via Sqoop and Spark.
  
- **Business Analysis**:
  - Customer segmentation and sales trend analysis.
  - Supply chain optimization.
  
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Predictive models for sales forecasting and customer retention.

- **Visualization**:
  - Data insights visualized using Tableau.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Hadoop Ecosystem (HDFS, Hive, Sqoop)
- Tableau
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `pyspark`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

Install Python libraries:
```bash
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pyspark
```

## Data

The project utilizes retail data, which includes the following datasets:

- **Customer Data**: Contains demographic details and purchasing behavior of customers.
- **Order Data**: Information on orders placed by customers, including timestamps, product details, and order status.
- **Product Data**: Data on the available products, including product names, categories, and pricing details.

### Data Sources

The data is sourced from:
- **Flat Files**: CSV, Parquet, JSON formats.
- **Cloud Storage**: Amazon S3, Redshift, Snowflake.
- **Hadoop Ecosystem**: HDFS, Hive for distributed storage and processing.

## Usage Instructions

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Use Sqoop to ingest data from relational databases into HDFS.
   - Data is stored in flat files (CSV, Parquet) or cloud storage (S3, Snowflake).

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Clean and transform the data using PySpark or Hive SQL queries.
   - Perform data cleansing to handle missing or inconsistent values.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Execute the Python scripts for customer segmentation and sales predictions.
   - Machine learning models are trained on the cleaned data to forecast future sales and improve inventory management.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Use Tableau to create dashboards and visualizations that display insights, such as sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Example Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Import data from flat files or databases, clean it, and prepare it for analysis.
2. **Modeling**: Train machine learning models (such as Random Forest, Decision Trees) to predict sales and customer trends.
3. **Visualization**: Generate visual reports using Tableau dashboards to show sales forecasts, customer segments, and product demand.

## Results

- **Customer Segmentation**: Identified customer clusters based on purchase behavior.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Developed predictive models for sales, enabling better stock management and pricing strategies.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Improved inventory control by analyzing product demand trends.

## Challenges

- **Data Quality Issues**: The raw data had missing values and inconsistencies, which required extensive cleansing.
- **Complex Queries**: Running complex SQL queries on large datasets required optimizing query performance in Hive.
- **Integration Issues**: Encountered difficulties with integrating PySpark and cloud storage systems such as S3 and Snowflake.

## Customization

To adapt this project to your own needs:
- **Replace the dataset**: Use your own dataset by uploading it into the appropriate storage system (HDFS, S3, etc.).
- **Modify the analysis**: Adjust the data preprocessing steps and machine learning models to fit your specific business requirements.
- **Extend visualizations**: Customize the Tableau dashboards by adding additional KPIs or modifying existing ones to suit your business needs.
